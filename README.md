# EMG-signal-processing
In this project, we have first, measured the EMG signals generated when performing 4 hand movements+rest: open, grasp, extension, flexion. Then we have preprocessed, classified, and processed the signal using KNN and LDA algorithms. The software used to collect the EMG signal is LabChart.
